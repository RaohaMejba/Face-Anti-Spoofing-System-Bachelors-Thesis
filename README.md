# Face Anti-Spoofing Attendance System 

This repository contains the source code for the **Face Anti-Spoofing System**, a real-time attendance authentication application designed and implemented as part of my Bachelor's thesis at Yangzhou University.

## Project Overview

The system is built around a lightweight **MiniFASNet** deep learning model, trained on a custom-developed dataset named **SARSpoof**, specifically curated with spoofing samples from South Asian individuals to reduce bias and improve accuracy.

Key components include:
- A **graphical user interface (GUI)** for user registration, login, and logout
- Integrated **spoof detection** and **face recognition** modules
- Real-world testing across different lighting, background, distance, and accessory scenarios
- Anti-spoofing protection against **print attacks** and **replay attacks**

## Key Features

-  **MiniFASNet Integration**: Lightweight and efficient CNN model for spoof detection
-  **Real-Time Detection**: Webcam-based face authentication and spoofing defense
-  **Logging**: Attendance data saved with timestamps in local log files
-  **Robust Evaluation**: Tested against diverse spoofing attempts (replay, print)
-  **Inclusive Design**: Tailored for the South Asian demographic

- ## Note on Dataset Privacy

>  **IMPORTANT:**  
> The **SARSpoof dataset** used in this project is currently unpublished and sensitive.  
> For security and ethical reasons, this repository has been set to **private** and the dataset is **not included** here.  
> Access to the dataset can be requested on a case-by-case basis for academic purposes only.
